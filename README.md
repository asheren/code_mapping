## Description
A little while ago, I started thinking about code confidence and how we as developers track how confident (or not confident) we are in our abilities and the code we are writing. This confidence can come from internal factors, many of which are stated in this [blog post](http://daydreamsinruby.com/exploring-my-code-confidence/), or from external factors like code reviews, teammate comments, meetup or conference connections, etc. The more we know about patterns and trends related to code confidence, the more we can be self-aware of high or low points and the more effectively we can communicate this information to teammates and others.

This application will do just that. Starting with a simple survey and growing into more, this application will help individuals track their levels of code confidence in order to deduce trends and patterns over time.
